# EditorBG
A Spore mod that adds over thirty new backgrounds for the Creature Editor play mode.

A huge thank you to Ramone Kemono (Baramanga) for helping me with effects in this mod, and to emd4600 for creating the tools used to make this mod!

A full list of backgrounds included in this mod along with the names of the users who suggested them can be found in the original DavoOnline thread:

I recommend using emd4600's More Background Buttons mod to make navigating through pages of backgrounds easier.
